'''
handle an unexpected or invalid input

The line is part of input validationâ€”it's acting as a fallback (or default case) to handle unexpected input. In technical terms, it's part of the "error handling" or "defensive programming" strategy. It doesn't fix a bug in the traditional sense (like correcting logic or syntax errors), but it prevents the program from proceeding with invalid input.
