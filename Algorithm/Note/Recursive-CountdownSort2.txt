In short:

Recursive Countdown:
Makes a single recursive call (e.g., countdown(n-1))
Simply decrements until reaching a base case (e.g., n â‰¤ 0)
Straightforward and linear in nature

Recursive Sort (e.g., Merge Sort):
Splits the data into parts with multiple recursive calls
Recursively sorts each part and then merges the sorted parts
More complex and typically operates in O(n log n) time
